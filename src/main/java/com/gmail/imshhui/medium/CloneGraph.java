/**
 * Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph, return a deep copy (clone) of the graph. Each node in the graph contains a val (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Input:
 * {"$id":"1","neighbors":[{"$id":"2","neighbors":[{"$ref":"1"},{"$id":"3","neighbors":[{"$ref":"2"},{"$id":"4","neighbors":[{"$ref":"3"},{"$ref":"1"}],"val":4}],"val":3}],"val":2},{"$ref":"4"}],"val":1}
 *
 * Explanation:
 * Node 1's value is 1, and it has two neighbors: Node 2 and 4.
 * Node 2's value is 2, and it has two neighbors: Node 1 and 3.
 * Node 3's value is 3, and it has two neighbors: Node 2 and 4.
 * Node 4's value is 4, and it has two neighbors: Node 1 and 3.
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * The number of nodes will be between 1 and 100.
 * The undirected graph is a simple graph, which means no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
 * Since the graph is undirected, if node p has node q as neighbor, then node q must have node p as neighbor too.
 * You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.
